# Spotify-Downloader

- Downloads songs fromÂ YouTube in an MP3 format by using Spotify's HTTP link.

- Can also download a song by entering its artist and song name (in case if you don't have the Spotify's HTTP link for some song).

- Automatically fixes song's meta-tags which include:

  - Title
  - Artist
  - Album
  - Album art
  - Album artist
  - Genre
  - Track number
  - Disc number
  - Release date
  - And some more...

- Works straight out of the box and does not require to generate or mess with your API keys.

That's how your Music library will look like!

## Reporting Issues

- Search for your problem in the [issues section](https://github.com/Ritiek/spotify-downloader/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=) before opening a new ticket. It might be already answered and save us time :smile:.

- Provide as much information possible when opening your ticket.

## Installation & Usage

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Dg8p9up.png" width="600">

- **This version supports Python 3**, Python 2 compatibility was dropped because of the way it deals with unicode. If you need to use Python 2 though, check out the `python2` branch.

- Note: `play` and `lyrics` commands have been deprecated in the current brach since they were not of much use and created unnecessary clutter. You can still get them back by using `old` branch though.

### Debian, Ubuntu, Linux & Mac

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/ritiek/spotify-downloader
cd spotify-downloader
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

You'll also need to install FFmpeg for conversion (use `--avconv` if you'd like to use that instead):

Linux: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`

Mac: `brew install ffmpeg --with-libmp3lame --with-libass --with-opus --with-fdk-aac`

If it does not install correctly, you may have to build it from source. For more info see https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide.

### Windows

Assuming you have Python already installed..

- Download FFmpeg for Windows from [here](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/). Copy `ffmpeg.exe` from `ffmpeg-xxx-winxx-static\bin\ffmpeg.exe` to `Scripts` folder (in your Python's installation directory: e.g. `C:\Python36\Scripts\ffmpeg.exe`)

- Download the [zip file](https://github.com/ritiek/spotify-downloader/archive/master.zip) of this repository and copy the folder contained in the archive into your Python's installation folder (e.g. `C:\Python36\spotify-downloader-master`).

- Open the folder from last step. Shift+right-click on empty area, open `cmd`, navigate to your Python installation directory and type:

  `"Scripts/pip.exe" install -U -r requirements.txt`

- If you do not want to naviagte to your Python folder from the command-line everytime you want to run the script, you can have your Python 'PATH' environment variables set and then you can run the script from any directory.

## Instructions for Downloading Songs

- For all available options, run `python spotdl.py --help` (or for Windows run `python.exe spotdl.py --help`).

```
usage: spotdl.py [-h] (-s SONG | -l LIST | -u USERNAME) [-n] [-m] [-f] [-v]
                 [-i INPUT_EXT] [-o OUTPUT_EXT]

Download and convert songs from Spotify, Youtube etc.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SONG, --song SONG  download song by spotify link or name (default: None)
  -l LIST, --list LIST  download songs from a file (default: None)
  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                        load user's playlists into <playlist_name>.txt
                        (default: None)
  -m, --manual          choose the song to download manually (default: False)
  -a, --avconv          Use avconv for conversion. If not set
                        defaults to FFmpeg (default: False)
  -v, --verbose         show debug output (default: False)
  -i INPUT_EXT, --input_ext INPUT_EXT
                        prefered input format .m4a or .webm (Opus) (default:
                        .m4a)
  -o OUTPUT_EXT, --output_ext OUTPUT_EXT
                        prefered output extension .mp3 or .m4a (AAC) (default:
                        .mp3)
```

#### Downloading by Name

For example

- We want to download Hello by Adele, simply run `python spotdl.py --song "adele hello"`.

- The script will automatically look for the best matching song and download it in the folder `Music/` placed in the root directory of the code base.

- It will now convert the song to an mp3 and try to fix meta-tags and album-art by looking up on Spotify.

#### Downloading by Spotify Link (Recommended)

For example

- We want to download the same song (i.e: Hello by Adele) but using Spotify Link this time that looks like  `http://open.spotify.com/track/1MDoll6jK4rrk2BcFRP5i7`, you can copy it from your Spotify desktop or mobile app by right clicking or long tap on the song and copy HTTP link.

- Run `python spotdl.py --song http://open.spotify.com/track/1MDoll6jK4rrk2BcFRP5i7`, it should download Hello by Adele.

- Just like before, it will again convert the song to an mp3 but since we used a Spotify HTTP link, the script is guaranteed to fetch the correct meta-tags and album-art.

#### Download multiple songs at once

For example

- We want to download `Hello by Adele`, `The Nights by Avicci` and `21 Guns by Green Day` just using a single command.

Let's suppose, we have the Spotify link for only `Hello by Adele` and `21 Guns by Green Day`.

No problem!

- Just make a `list.txt` in the same folder as the script and add all the songs you want to download, in our case it is

(if you are on Windows, just edit `list.txt` - i.e `C:\Python36\spotify-downloader-master\list.txt`)

```
https://open.spotify.com/track/1MDoll6jK4rrk2BcFRP5i7
the nights avicci
http://open.spotify.com/track/64yrDBpcdwEdNY9loyEGbX
```

- Now pass `--list=list.txt` to the script, i.e `python spotdl.py --list=list.txt` and it will start downloading songs mentioned in `list.txt`.

- You can stop downloading songs by hitting `ctrl+c`, the script will automatically resume from the song where you stopped it the next time you want to download the songs present in `list.txt`.

- Songs that are already downloaded will be skipped and not be downloaded again.

#### Downloading playlists

- You can also load songs from any playlist provided you have a Spotify username or user id of that user. (Open profile in Spotify, click on the three little dots below name, "Share", "Copy to clipboard", paste last numbers into command-line: `https://open.spotify.com/user/0123456790`)

- Try running `python spotdl.py -u <your_username>`, it will show all your public playlists.

- Once you select the one you want to download, the script will load all the tracks from the playlist into `<playlist_name>.txt`

- Then you can simply run `python spotdl.py --list=<playlist_name>.txt` to download them all!

## Running tests

`python -m pytest test`

Obviously this requires the `pytest` module to be installed.
