# Spotify-Downloader

◘ This little python script allows downloading songs from Spotify just by entering the song's HTTP link or its URI in an MP3 format.

◘ You can also download a song by entering its artist and song name.

◘ Downloading a song using spotify link will automatically fix its meta-tags and add a nice a albumart to the song.

That's how your Music library will look like!

## Step by step Instructions for Downloading songs:

First launch the script using the above command as mentioned for your OS.

#### Downloading by Name:

For example:

◘ We want to download Hello by Adele, simply run the script and type ```adele hello```.

◘ The script will automatically look for the best matching song and download it in the folder ```Music/``` placed in your current directory.

◘ It will now convert the song to an mp3.

◘ Now, if we want to check it out the lyrics of that song, just type ```lyrics``` in the script and it should print out the lyrics for any last downloaded song.

◘ Okay, lets play the song now. Just type ```play``` in the script.

#### Downloading by Spotify Link:

For example:

◘ We want to download the same song (i.e: Hello by Adele) but using Spotify Link this time that looks like  ```http://open.spotify.com/track/1MDoll6jK4rrk2BcFRP5i7```, you can copy it from your Spotify desktop or mobile app by right clicking or long tap on the song and copy HTTP link.

◘ Now simply paste this link after running the script, it should download Hello by Adele.

◘ Just like before, it will again convert the song to an mp3.

◘ Now, that we have used a Spotify link to download the song, the script will automatically fix the meta-tags and add an album-art to the song.

◘ Similarly, we can now check out its lyrics or play it.

◘ Just type ```exit``` to exit out of the script.

#### What if we want to download multiple songs at once?

For example:

◘ We want to download Hello by Adele, The Nights by Avicci and 21 Guns by Green Day just using a single command.

Also this time we have the Spotify link only for Hello by Adele but not for other two songs.

No problem!

◘ Just make a list.txt by running the following commands:

```
cd
cd Spotify-Downloader/Music
sudo nano list.txt
```
(if you are on windows, just edit list.txt - i.e ```C:\Python27\Music\list.txt```)

add all the songs you want to download, in our case it is:

```
https://open.spotify.com/track/1MDoll6jK4rrk2BcFRP5i7
the nights avicci
21 guns green day
```

◘ Now just run the script and type ```list```, it will automatically start downloading the songs you provided in list.txt

◘ You can stop downloading songs by hitting ```ctrl+c```, the script will automatically resume from the song where you stopped it the next time you want to download the songs using ```list```.
