#! Basic necessities to get the CLI running
from spotdl.search import spotifyClient
from spotdl.spotDlApp import SpotDlApp

#! The actual download stuff
from spotdl.download.downloader import DownloadManager

from argparse import ArgumentParser
import sys

#! to avoid packaging errors
from multiprocessing import freeze_support

#! Usage is simple - call 'python __main__.py <links, search terms, tracking files seperated by spaces>
#! Eg.
#!      python __main__.py https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWXhcuQw7KIeM?si=xubKHEBESM27RqGkqoXzgQ 'old gods of asgard Control' https://open.spotify.com/album/2YMWspDGtbDgYULXvVQFM6?si=gF5dOQm8QUSo-NdZVsFjAQ https://open.spotify.com/track/08mG3Y1vljYA6bvDt4Wqkj?si=SxezdxmlTx-CaVoucHmrUA
#!
#! Well, yeah its a pretty long example but, in theory, it should work like a charm. 
#!
#! A '.spotdlTrackingFile' is automatically  created with the name of the first song in the playlist/album or
#! the name of the song supplied. We don't really re re re-query YTM and SPotify as all relevant details are
#! stored to disk.
#!
#! Files are cleaned up on download failure.
#!
#! All songs are normalized to standard base volume. the soft ones are made louder, the loud ones, softer.
#!
#! The progress bar is synched across multiple-processes (4 processes as of now), getting the progress bar to
#! synch was an absolute pain, each process knows how much 'it' progressed, but the display has to be for the
#! overall progress so, yeah... that took time.
#!
#! spotdl will show you its true speed on longer download's - so make sure you try downloading a playlist.
#!
#! still yet to try and package this but, in theory, there should be no errors.
#!
#!                                                          - cheerio! (Michael)

#! P.S. Tell me what you think. Up to your expectations?
