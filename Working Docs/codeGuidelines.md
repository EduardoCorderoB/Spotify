# What is this file?

This is where a list of the smaller code guidelines like variable naming will
be listed out. Some of the gains from the following guidelines might seem
negligible, but for large code bases, those marginal gains will add up to
sizable improvements.

# Guidelines

## Naming

- Use snake case naming. A constant naming style decreases the overhead
cognitive load of reading through the code. It might be an unconscious gain
but is well worth it in the case of large code bases.

- Use descriptive names. Variable names like `fourTire` is a bad variable name
because it doesn't tell you anything about how the variable functions. An
alternate better variable name would be `car` or `duneBuggy`.

- When using use mnemonic variables(pronounceable variable names). `gtwy` as an
acronym for `gateway` is a bad choice because, it can't be pronounced, `gway`
is comparatively better because it is pronounceable. Research shows that
mnemonic names are more easily remembered and discussed.
