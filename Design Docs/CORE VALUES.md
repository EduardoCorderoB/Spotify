# What is this file?

Every project has a few core values (or at least should have a few core values) that
guide every decision/line of code ever written. This is where our core values will be
listed. They might seem silly but, you are expected to go beyond the standards set by our
values and turn in some truly well thought out code.

You might notice that all the 'core values' of spot-dl are in a two-part format, what
matters of these are the first halves, the second halves merely serve as rule of thumb
counterparts to their vague former halves. As a coder/contributor to spot-dl, youâ€™re not
expected to merely satisfy the rule-of-thumb counterparts but push far beyond them.

# Our Values

- Accurate & Fast Downloads - a user should be able to find and download the song
he/she/them want in under 3 attempts at max and under 1 attempt most of the times and is
the shortest time possible

- Provide accurate metadata - all downloads should have the correct metadata.

- Simple scalable design (Ease of contribution) - a programmer should understand what
does what and be free to start working on his/her/their contributions in under 30 minutes.
